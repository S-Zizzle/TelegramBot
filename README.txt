To-do:
  - clean the printing of the hangman
  - keep track of games played + won (in a txt file?)
  - 1v1 mode?
  - uddate bot commands to be status not print
  - buy me a coffee button
  - ignore commands from guesses
  - /message command to send bugs, features, etc. Concat these msgs to a text file, then send me a private message when a new one appears
  - Sort Hangman object cleanup/re-use
  - Make more use of Hangman class, and maybe seperate file so this main code is cleaner
  - update.effective_chat.id or game.chat_id???????
